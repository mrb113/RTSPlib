RTSPlib
=======

RTSP parser written in C. Alternatively, "why strings in C89 aren't fun".

Note: This was my preliminary effort on RTSP parsing. I now maintain the code elsewhere - I've since spruced it up and integrated it into Moonlight Game Streaming.

### If you're looking at this RTSP parser for a reference:

It seems like a fair amount of people come here for a reference to an RTSP parer. I encourage you to look at the RTSP files in Moonlight Common C where it's maintained now instead of this one. I like to leave this repository here anyway.
